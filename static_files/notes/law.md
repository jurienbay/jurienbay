## Visual Meteorological Conditions

Reference - AIP ENR 1.2, para 2.

There are two sets of rules under which an aircraft can operate;

- visual flight rules (VFR),
- instrument flight rules (IFR).

Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) are defined in terms of flight
visibility which are vertical and horizontal distances from cloud.

To operate under visual rules, the conditions must be equal or exceed
minimum VMC otherwise the aircraft must operate under IFR. However a
IFR aircraft may choose to operate under IFR procedures in VFR conditions.

### Visual Flight Rules (VFR)

Reference - AIP ENR 1.2

VFR requires VMC and you must be;

- subsonic,
- be able to navigate by visual reference to the ground/water while operating
  at or below 2,000ft AGL.

If in controlled airspace you are required to notify ATC if you deviate more
than 1nm off track.

If you fly over BKN [5-7oktas] you must;

- maintain VMC,
- able to visually fix position atleast every 30 minutes,
- ensure from MET reports and forecasts that VMC can be maintained though descent
  and thoughtout the flight to the destination or alternate.

Worst case, if TAF or other forecast for destination is unavailable, call a
local authority to gauge local weather conditions.

### Special VFR

Reference - AIP ENR 1.2 para 1.2

ATC may authorise flight under special VFR rules in controlled airspace,
specifically C and D only, upon pilot request provided;

- will not delay IFR,
- maintain VMC,
- visibility is not less than 1.6km,
- you remain above 500ft AGL if unpopulated or 1,000ft AGL if populated.

## Rights of Way

Reference - CASR 91.330 - 91.335

- Power-driven aircraft must give way to airships, gliders, balloons and to
  towing aircraft.
- If approaching an aircraft head-on, turn right!
- Give way to aircraft on your right.
- An aircraft being overtaken has right of way.
- While overtaking, make all turns to the right.
- Do not overtake by climbing or diving.
- Give way to an aircraft landing or on Final.
- Give way to an aircraft in an emergency.
- While on Final, give way to aircraft at a lower height or traffic on the runway.
